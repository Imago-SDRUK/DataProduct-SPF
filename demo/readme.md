#### Description 
This folder contains technical stuff for the workflow development, currently with the working versions of Notebooks to produce the cloud probability product:
* **`cloud_odcstac.ipynb`** – utilises `odc-stac` and `xarray` (current)
* **`cloud_pystac.ipynb`** – utilises `pystac-client`, `rasterio`, and `numpy` (legacy)
