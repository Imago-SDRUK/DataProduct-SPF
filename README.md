## ☀️ SPF: How Does Sunniness Matter?
A comprehensive toolkit for measuring sunlight exposure in the UK level.

## 📖 What is this?
This repository provides researchers with ready-to-use tools for measuring sunlight exposure across UK geographic areas and integrating these measures with socio-economic datasets. We calculate sun probability factor (SPF) using cloud mask layers from Sentinel satellite data, providing unprecedented spatial precision for understanding how cloudiness of your living space affects behavior and outcomes.
 
## ⭐ Key Features
- LSOA-Level Sun Exposure Measures: Annual sunlight metrics at the LSOA level—the same geographic unit used for most UK administrative and survey data—making integration seamless
- High Spatial Precision: Derived from Sentinel satellite data at 20m resolution, aggregated to match your existing datasets
- Simple Integration: Merge exposure data with your existing datasets using standard LSOA codes—no GIS expertise required
- Analysis Templates: Example scripts demonstrating how you can use this data product.
